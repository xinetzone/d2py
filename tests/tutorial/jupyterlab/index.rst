JupyterLab
==========

`JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an
extensible, feature-rich editor for creating and editing :doc:`Jupyter Notebooks
<../notebook/index>`:

* You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in your
  workspace using tabs.
* Code consoles provide temporary scratchpads for running code interactively,
  which can also be linked to a :doc:`notebook kernel <../kernels/index>`.
* There is also preview of
  :doc:`python4datascience:data-processing/serialisation-formats/csv/index` and
  :doc:`pyviz:vega/index` files.
* :doc:`extensions` can customise or enhance any part of JupyterLab.

JupyterLab currently uses the same Notebook document format as the classic
:doc:`Jupyter Notebook <../notebook/index>`. Notebook 7 will replace the classic
Jupyter Notebook format.

Binder
======

`Binder <https://jupyter.org/binder>`_ provides an easy way to share computer
environments with everyone. Binder is used for

Teaching and training
    Binder can be used to share links to interactive data analysis environments.
    This is great for workshops, tutorials and courses and allows you to get
    students up to speed with the code much more quickly.
Technical documentation
    Binder tools can be used to make documentation and demonstrations of tools
    interactive.
Open educational resources
    Binder can provide publicly available interactive educational materials,
    enabling richer experiences.
Reproducible scientific analysis
    Binder allows you to share an interactive environment along with your code
    and analysis. You can share a link where others can reproduce and interact
    with your work. For example, the `Neurolibre <https://neurolibre.org>`_
    project uses Binder to reproduce neuroscience analyses.

Binder provides a full open-source infrastructure stack. The main tools are
